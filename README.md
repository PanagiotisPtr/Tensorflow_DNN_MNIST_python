# Feed Forward DNN in Tensorflow
A simple feed forward neural network written in python with tensorflow to classify hand written digits from the mnist dataset

### Deep Learning Topics Applied on this project
  - Early Stopping
  - Dropout
  - Cross Entropy Loss Function
  - Gradient Descent Optimization (Done by the tensorflow API)

### What is this project for?
This project is mostly an applications from what I have read from the "Deep Learning" Book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.
You are welcome to read the code and replicate the results.

##### Disclaimer
This project isn't meant for production and is mostly an experimentation. I still am a novice Python programmer and as such the code design isn't all that great

##### Foot note
I hope that you find this project informative and educational. Keep on learning!
